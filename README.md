i’m 12  
i break things to understand them  
interested in ai safety, alignment, and red teaming 
reasons to give me money or robux:
1. bc i donate all of it away
2. i cant legally work
3. ur generous enough, right?

**languages:**
luau (learning), python (beefing)  
**projects:** 
small tools, experiments, unfinished ideas  
**contact:**
discord > email (user: dogebroj. wont accept random friend requests so tell me ur from github).

skiing, anime, building breaking things and expanding my snack business (in school. also it made 200 bucks in 2 months. insane).
